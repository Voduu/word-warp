            WORD WARP - HELP
===========================================

Welcome to Word Warp! 

Word Warp is a text-based word scramble game where you're given a shuffled 
7-letter word. Your goal is to determine the original word to advance to the 
next round.

In addition to unscrambling the main word, you must also find as many 
sub-words as possible using the given letters. Sub-words must be at least 
3 letters long.

Each valid word earns you points based on its length.

You have 3 "Word Warps," which allow you to reshuffle the main word. This 
may help you spot new sub-words more easily.

A two-minute timer per round will be implemented in the future, along with 
save functionality so you can continue later, and a high-score board.

===========================================
              HOW TO PLAY
===========================================

At the prompt, type words you find. If the word is valid, it will be 
registered, and you will earn points based on its length.

Undiscovered words will be shown as dashes representing their length. 
For example, if "fine" has not been found yet, it will appear as:

    ---- 

All sub-words will be listed in alphabetical order to help track which 
words you still need to discover.

Additional commands may be made at the prompt while playing to perfom the 
following:

    !shuffle - shuffles the main word, up to three times.
    !exit - exits the game, will save the game once that functionality is added.

             FUTURE FEATURES
===========================================

Planned updates include an options menu where you can select word length, 
adjust the time limit, and customize other settings.
